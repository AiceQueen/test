In this Letter, we demonstrate a 10 GHz comb with 38 comb lines within a spectral power variation below 1 dB. The number of comb lines that can be generated is limited by the power handling capability of the phase modulator, and this can be scaled without compromising the spectral flatness. Furthermore, the spectral phase of the generated combs in our scheme is almost purely quadratic, which, as we will demonstrate, allows for high-quality pulse compression using only single-mode fiber.",

Such spectra can be generated by diverse sources such as mode-locked lasers, resonators, or electro-optic modulators. This last possibility has shown a growing interest in the recent years for its advantageous features in providing high repetition rates, intrinsic mutual coherence, or high power per comb lines. Moreover, applications of electro-optic modulator-based combs have flourished in fundamental physics, spectroscopy, or instrumental calibrations. In this paper, we present the most recent progresses made on frequency combs generated by electro-optic modulators, along with the applications where these combs have shown a particular interest.",

		"abstract": "Flat optical frequency comb (OFC) can be generated by using single phase modulator (PM), where combined harmonics are applied to drive the PM. However, the number of comb lines and flatness of OFC are limited under this scheme. In this work, we use cascaded PMs with combined harmonics to generate flat OFC. The optimized phases and modulation indices in terms of amplitudes for each harmonic are obtained by solving optimization problem to minimize the fluctuation of OFC with a certain number of comb lines. Both simulation and experiment are carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Regarding the case of combined fundamental tone, third harmonic, and fifth harmonic, a 15-line OFC is generated with the flatness of 0.29 dB and 0.65 dB observed in simulation and experiment, respectively. Other feasible solutions to flat OFC with combined harmonics are also investigated.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents an optical carrier supply module (OCSM) that functions as a common multicarrier light source, a wavelength bank, for superdense wavelength-division multiplexing (SD-WDM) networks that utilize a large number of wavelengths with narrow channel spacing. A novel sideband generator based on a sinusoidal amplitude-phase hybrid modulation scheme is the key technique. The sideband generator generates nine flattened optical sidebands within 3 dB from one seed light source, and the input from wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) seed carriers expands the number of generated sidebands. Scalability against the number of wavelengths is achieved by increasing the number of seed carriers used. The SD-WDM system employing OCSM reduces the number of laser diodes (LDs) and attendant wavelength monitoring/stabilization circuits. Multiple distributions to SD-WDM networks by splitting the OCSM output can promote this effect. We designed OCSM and experimentally investigated its performance pertaining to the electrical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the OCSM output. The experimental results show the wavelength scalability to 1000 channels. We also developed an OCSM prototype that generated 12.5-GHz-spaced 256-channel WDM carriers. All the generated carriers exhibit the electrical SNR of more than 31.5 dB at 2.5 Gb/s and the power flatness of within 3 dB. The distribution over 100 SD-WDM networks is experimentally confirmed.",

In addition, the maximum output OSNR and optimal radio-frequency drive voltages in the cases of different desired carrier numbers have been obtained. Using the improved configuration, 130-tone with high-quality (tone-to-noise ratio ∼20dB and superior flatness <3dB) where the drive voltage is only around 0.5Vπ can be achieved.

A primary seed OFC is rooted from the nonlinear dynamics in the optically injected semiconductor laser, and its performance is improved using a two-stage booster based on subharmonic electro-optic modulation and the FWM effect. The comb spacing can be easily tuned by adjusting that of the primary seed OFC or through electro-optic modulation by the use of subharmonics with different orders. Moreover, it becomes stabilized because the phase relationship between the comb teeth can be fixed in the process of subharmonic electro-optic modulation. Its optical spectrum continues to be broadened in the following FWM process. Finally, robust OFCs with a comb spacing of 4 GHz and a comb teeth number of 23 and a comb spacing of 5 GHz and a comb teeth number of 21 are experimentally demonstrated.",
